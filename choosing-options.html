      <h1>Choosing options</h1>

      <p>
        It seems that it can be differentiated between where one makes choices (via free choice) and one's will being surrendered at depth to God.
      </p>

      <p>Choosing options seems only relevant for when one still makes choices with the will.</p>

      <p>When one has surrendered one's will at depth to God, choosing options seems to be irrelevant, because then it's up to God.</p>
