      <h1>Identifying content with a low consciousness level</h1>

      <p><strong>Method:</strong> Consciousness levels calibration (cal. 605)</p>

      <h2>Definition</h2>

      <p>
        Multiple different definitions seems to be reasonable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Definition 1:</strong> Content which calibrates below consciousness level 200 on the Map of the Scale of Consciousness. The consciousness levels below 200 being regarded as “functionally false”.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Definition 2:</strong> Content which calibrates below a minimum level which is regarded appropriate for the type of content. E.g. science “should” mainly produce content which calibrates from 450 (inclusive) to 460 (inclusive).
