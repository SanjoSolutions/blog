      <h1>Keeping a company integrous</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> For this work, the definition of “integrous company” is considered to be a company with only employees and contractors which calibrate at or above consciousness level 200 on the <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=1V_6DwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=healing%20and%20recovery&pg=PA475#v=onepage&q=healing%20and%20recovery&f=false" target="_blank">Map of the Scale of Consciousness</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Further considerations</h2>

      <p>
        With what entities (companies and people) is worked with seems also relevant.
      </p>

      <h2>Measurements to keep a company integrous</h2>

      <p>It seems to make sense to let go of company relationships where the other party calibrates below consciousness level 200.</p>

      <p>
        Also it seems to make sense to only start relationships with companies and people which are integrous.
        It seems to make sense to explicitly calibrate if starting a relationship serves the highest good, because
        the answer of the calibration can include unknown karmic factors that otherwise might only be apparent
        in the future unfolding, like a drop of consciousness level (especially below 200) based on karmic propensities.
      </p>

      <h2>Staying integrous</h2>

      <p>
        The most effective way seems to be, to surrender one's will at depth to God (cal. 850).
        The reason is that negative consequences can only follow as a consequence of a choice by the will (with small 'w') - the personal will of the soul.
        Therefore by surrendering one's will at depth to God, a descend (a lower consciousness level) can be precluded.
        Therefore if one calibrates at or above 200 on the Map of the Scale of Consciousness,
        by surrendering one's will at depth to God, one can "ensure" that one's consciousness level stays at least at the same consciousness level.
